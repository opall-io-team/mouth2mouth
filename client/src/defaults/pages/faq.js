			q: 'What is permanent cosmetics?',
			a: 'Permanent makeup is a cosmetic technique which employs tattoos as a mean of producing designs that resemble makeup, such as eye lining and other permanent enhancing colors to the skin of the face, lips, and eyelids.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Is permanent cosmetic similar to tattooing?',
			a: 'It has some of the same qualities. Yet it is very different. Only specialists in micro-pigmentation can perform this procedure on the face; tattoo artists cannot. We only use only the techniques, tools, and pigments specifically designed for micro-pigmentation procedures. Making it safe, sterile, and painless. Permanent makeup clinicians also use effective topical anesthetics that are not allowed for use by tattoo artists. The mouth2mouth beauty bar only uses instruments much more delicate in design that provide natural-looking results.',
		},
		{
			q: 'Is permanent cosmetic safe?',
			a: 'The procedures are performed under sterile conditions. Using only disposable needle cartridges and with digitally controlled implantation devices. There are no long-term side effects; short-term effects may include some redness, swelling, and tenderness. There are no known allergic reactions to pigments.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How long does the procedure take to complete?',
			a: 'The average time required for a procedure is between 2 - 3 hours',
		},
		{
			q: 'How long does the permanent makeup last?',
			a: 'Gradual fading can be expected for all micro-pigmentation procedures, this varies among people and is dependant on the specific shade used. Most colors last 3 - 5 years, although some may not fade for as long as 10 years. Periodic touchups are recommended to maintain the desired look. You can also choose to change the colors of your permanent makeup. For instance, a nude lip color can be modified to be a peach pink or a brown eyeliner to a black or navy hue.',
		},
		{
			q: 'How do the qualifications of the Mouth2Mouth Beauty Bar differ from other permanent makeup practitioners?',
			a: 'Other practitioners combine their interest in permanent makeup with other beauty treatments, such as working with hair and nails. They often receive their “certification” for permanent makeup application by attending one- or two-day seminar with little or no hands-on experience. They actually start their permanent makeup experience practicing on their first clients, and this can greatly jeopardize the client’s safety and satisfaction.',
