			title: 'Reiki Energy Healing for Mind, Body, Spirit',
			description: 'Today many people are in great need of healing and/or relief from illnesses, past traumas, stress, and addictions. Reiki is healing energy in its truest sense for the mind, body, and spirit. As a Reiki practitioner, I channel life energy through their hands to the recipient. This energy activates the body’s natural ability to heal itself. The energy goes to the deepest levels of a person’s being, where illnesses have their origin. It works wherever the recipient needs it most, releasing blocked energies, cleansing the body of toxins, and working to create a state of balance.'
